# OwnPrototype
#Using the MDA framework, I wanted to create a simple and purely fun experience so I set out to create a platformer but I wasn't able to make the character jump.
#Instead, based on a suggestion from a classmate, I created platforms that would move along the y-axis so the player can reach certain areas.
#The mechanics of the game are simple just rolling a ball.
#The dynamics come in how the player plans on getting to the goal. They could attempt to roll ahead quickly and take the risk of getting squished by an enemy or falling off a platform.
#Or they could take it slow to grab coins and time when they need to get on or off the platform.
#The aesthetics would be the frustration off missing a platform or coin and the feeling of accomplishment after reaching the goal.
#I hope that by creating a prototype like this I can make more complicated games in the future.
